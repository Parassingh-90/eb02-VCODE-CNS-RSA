#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will enter two large Prime numbers. | Values of n and phi will be calculated. | User will be able to visulaize the calculation of n and phi.
2.| Student will chose value of e. | Public key and Private key will be calculated.  | User will be able to understand the Public-Private key generation.
3.| Student will enter the message and click encrypt button. | The entered message will be encrypted. | User will learn about encryption of message using Public key.
4.| Student will send the message. | The encrypted message will be sent to the reciever.  | The encrypted message transmission from sender to reciever will be demonstrated.
5.| Student will click decrypt button. | The recieved message will be decrypted.  | User will learn about decryption of message using Private key.
