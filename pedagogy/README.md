#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative 

<u> <b>Description: </b> of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: </u>
<br>
 <div align="justify">Firstly input two large Prime numbers and than compute the n and phi value.User has to select the value of e.Based on e value private and public keys get generated.Now user has to provide message in term of number to encrypt and then select decrypt option to generate same message in term of number as plain text.</div>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will enter two large Prime numbers. | Values of n and phi will be calculated. |<div align="justify">User will be able to visulaize the calculation of n and phi.</div>
2.| Student will chose value of e. | Public key and Private key will be calculated.  |<div align="justify">User will be able to understand the Public-Private key generation.</div>
3.| Student will enter the message and click encrypt button. | The entered message will be encrypted. |<div align="justify">User will learn about encryption of message using Public key.</div>
4.| Student will send the message. | The encrypted message will be sent to the reciever.  |<div align="justify">The encrypted message transmission from sender to reciever will be demonstrated.</div>
5.| Student will click decrypt button. | The recieved message will be decrypted.  |<div align="justify">User will learn about decryption of message using Private key.</div>
