<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The objective of this lab is that student must able to know Asymmetric Cryptography process to secure message using RSA Algorithm

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

<div align="justify">RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric means that there are two different keys. This is also called public key cryptography, because one of the keys can be given to anyone. The other key must be kept private. The algorithm is based on the fact that finding the factors of a large composite number is difficult-when the factors are prime numbers, the problem is called prime factorization. It is also a key pair (public and private key) generator.</div>
