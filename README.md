<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

This Lab is all about the Cryptography and Network Security Lab

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

<div align="justify">The most common public key algorithm is RSA which is named after Rivest,Shamir and Adleman.Public Key Algorithm also known as Asymmetric Key Cryptography.In asymmetric key cryptography two different keys are used one is public key and other is private key.Public key is announced to user and Private key is kept secret by owner.Today modern system use RSA algorithm to secure the message.RSA Algorithm bascially work on factoring large interger number that are product of two(2) large prime numbers.</div>
